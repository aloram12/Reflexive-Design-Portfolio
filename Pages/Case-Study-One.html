    description: `The Green River Coalition is a nonprofit 
    environmental organization dedicated to restoring and preserving natural 
    habitats throughout the Green River watershed. Their team manages numerous 
    outdoor restoration sites, oversees volunteer efforts, and compiles detailed 
    progress reports for grant funders who are an essential aspect of sustaining financial 
    support. For this capstone project, the design and development team selected the 
    Coalition as a client due to their alignment with community-driven environmental 
    work and the pressing need to improve internal reporting systems. The collaboration 
    aimed to build a sustainable digital solution to reduce reporting burdens and improve 
    operational clarity.`,

    description: `Once the first two rounds of meetings happened between the team 
    and organization members, it was concluded that the Coalition's internal processes 
    heavily relied on trust and unstructured Excel spreadsheets to document employee 
    activities and resource usage. Although this approach had worked informally in the past, 
    it produced a level of inconsistency that would create unsustainable workload on the 
    organization’s lead grant writer. Different types of records could be recorded daily, and having 
    weeks worth of work without consistency and structure could eventually make 
    future grant funding less likely or delayed.
    It became clear that a scalable, user-friendly system was necessary to streamline data 
    collection and maintain funding reliability.`,

  header: 'Importance of Finding a Solution', 
  description: `Grant funders and board members are still involved with progress and 
  restoratoin site activities but the Coalition’s
   tracking system began to reveal serious vulnerabilities that could further the knowledge gap between 
   employees and board members. Funders required not
    just general summaries but detailed breakdowns of work by location, task, and timing for a bigger picture.
     Without structured data, the organization faced the threat of funding gaps that could
      halt critical restoration projects. For the capstone team, the situation offered a real-world
       challenge to apply user-centered design methods while making a meaningful impact. The objective
        was to deliver a solution that would provide clarity and credibility to the Coalition’s
         reporting—offering long-term operational resilience.` },

   toward defining a robust data structure that could scale with the Coalition’s needs.
    The team created a centralized database schema focused on restoration sites as the 
    primary unit of organization. Each site entry included detailed logs, event records, 
    photo uploads, and resource counts. This architecture enabled consistency across data 
    entries while allowing for future expansion into reporting dashboards and permission-based 
    access levels.`,

  This version of the project focused on utilizing familiar software and 
  data storage capablities provided through Microsoft. With the use of newly made tools, progress was often halted 
  or delayed for some time because of the steep learning curve needed to 
  integrate different parts of the microsoft suite such as DataVerse, OneDrive, PowerApps, and security integrations
  for users to have access to different parts of the site. However, during this time of development strong communication
  between team and client allowed for quick feedback loops from the client
  that also provided insights into the Coalition’s day-to-day data needs. The app included basic
  journaling features, image upload options, and status tracking per site. While functional,
  this version of the project did not meet the quality needed in order for end users to successfully save and 
  create new data entry logs for their daily work progress.`,

  description: `When returning to the project in another academic quarter, the team was encouraged to include a 
  more customized and working solution for the clients. 
   Many of the original processes and features were transferred in the best possible way, with 
  focus on data storage, data retrieval, and representation being done with REACT and an MVC (Model View Controller) framework. 
  Once again, there was a new learning curve for the team to go through but with the same dedication, effort, and discipline
  that was used for the previous version of the project the team knew they could pull through. Both old and modern versions 
  of wireframes, use cases,  and database models were discussed for hours to avoid issues later 
  on in development.
  Recognizing the need for a more scalable and feature-rich platform, 
  the team rebuilt the application using a .NET framework with a React front end and MVC 
  (Model-View-Controller) architecture. This updated version supported better data handling 
  and offered a smoother experience for users managing multiple sites. 
  The redesigned interface allowed for more flexible inputs, refined status 
  tracking, and more intuitive navigation tailored to the Coalition’s workflows. `,

  allowing users to quickly view and update status information. Volunteer entry logs, 
  resource summaries, and site-specific notes were also integrated to ensure the interface
